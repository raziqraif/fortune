Week 4 (Plan) (Scrum master: TBD)
[Meetings]
03/03 Sprint 2 planning meeting
03/05 Stand up meeting






[Individual Goals]
Blake Steel: Start implementation of game screen off strong.


Ryan Huff: Implement using environment variables in production server rather than change the code itself. Possibly work on automation of deployment to production rather than restarting docker-compose each time a new feature is pulled into develop branch. Begin work on portions of game page


Sam Kravitz: Work on making protected routes on frontend only render if authorized user is signed in and add more frontend features, such as playing the game itself.


Akash Lankala: Main focus on backend schema and migrating database with scripts. Write scripts to access/insert data on the backend, as well as being able to fetch data from the background. With this knowledge, create migration scripts to be applied to the database. Will gain a stronger understanding of how the backend works in this sprint. API will also be introduced this week and connecting the API with the frontend and database will be a focus for this sprint as well.


Raziq Ramli: Work on and test pages on the frontend. Pick up how to use enzyme for testing.


Tyler Stanish: Real-time data integration
