[Individual Goals]
Blake Steel: Write tests for create game page, make login page


Ryan Huff: Create registration page, get production server ready for hosting our end-product of Sprint 1, in particular setting up docker compose and secure networking in/out of our server


Sam Kravitz: Begin implementing a few routes in backend and figure out how to send data to the database and query from it. Ran into significant blocks this week because postgres released a breaking update this week.


Akash Lankala: Complete setting up testing framework & smoke tests on client. Research accessing/inserting data on backend, as well as being able to fetch data from the background. With this knowledge, create migration scripts to be applied to the database.


Raziq Ramli: Learn to write tests for react components and start writing tests. Improve the method to manage active coins in the create game page.


Tyler Stanish: Finish work with authentication decorator and historical data.
